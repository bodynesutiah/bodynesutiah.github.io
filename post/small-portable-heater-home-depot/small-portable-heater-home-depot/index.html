Place your heater on a stable, level surface away from flammable materials and foot traffic areas. Maintain a minimum clearance of three feet around the heater on all sides to prevent overheating and fire hazards. Never leave a heater unattended while it’s in use, especially when children or pets are present. Keep combustible materials like curtains, clothes, and furniture at a safe distance from the heater to avoid accidental ignition. Use caution when operating the heater near water sources or in humid environments to prevent electrical hazards. Ensure proper ventilation to prevent carbon monoxide buildup, which can be fatal. Open windows slightly or use a carbon monoxide detector for added safety. Be mindful of the heater’s cord placement to avoid tripping hazards. Inspect the heater regularly for any signs of damage, loose connections, or frayed wires. If you notice any issues, discontinue use immediately and seek professional assistance.
