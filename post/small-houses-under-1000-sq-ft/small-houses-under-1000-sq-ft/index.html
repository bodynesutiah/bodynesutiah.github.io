Utilize the height of walls by hanging artwork, mirrors, and decorative items to create the illusion of a larger space. Multifunctional Furniture: Choose furniture pieces that serve multiple purposes, such as a sofa with built-in storage or a coffee table with a hidden compartment. Opt for modular or stackable furniture that can be easily rearranged to accommodate different needs and occasions. Invest in convertible furniture, such as a sofa bed or a dining table that can be extended to seat more guests. Smart Storage Solutions: Utilize every nook and cranny for storage by incorporating built-in shelves, drawers, and cabinets wherever possible. Install hooks on walls and doors to hang items like coats, bags, and keys, keeping surfaces clutter-free. Consider investing in under-bed storage containers or ottomans with hidden storage compartments. Natural Light and Ventilation: Maximize natural light by incorporating large windows and skylights, making the space feel more spacious and airy. Position windows strategically to capture cross-breezes and promote natural ventilation, reducing the need for air conditioning. Use sheer curtains or blinds to filter light and maintain privacy while still allowing natural light to enter.
