Variable Fan Speed: Consider heaters with adjustable fan speeds to customize noise levels as needed. Adjustable Thermostat: Precise Temperature Control: Choose heaters with adjustable thermostats to maintain your desired room temperature. Energy Savings: Adjustable thermostats enable you to set and maintain a consistent temperature, potentially saving energy.
