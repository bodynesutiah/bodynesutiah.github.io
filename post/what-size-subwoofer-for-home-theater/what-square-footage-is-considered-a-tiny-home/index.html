These homes are designed to maximize space while providing essential amenities and comfortable living quarters. Whether on wheels or built on a foundation, tiny homes prioritize functionality and efficient use of space.</p><h3 id=square-footage-specifications><strong>Square footage specifications</strong>:<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#square-footage-specifications>#</a></h3><p>While there is no universal definition, tiny homes typically fall within specific square footage ranges.</p><ul><li><p>*<strong>Standard Tiny Homes</strong>: These range from 100 to 200 square feet.
