Avoid placing the camera in areas with excessive movement (like near plants or trees). Video Lag or Poor Quality:\nEnsure your internet upload speed meets the camera’s requirements. Check your router’s bandwidth usage; too many devices can slow down the connection. Try connecting the camera using an Ethernet cable for a more stable connection. Consider upgrading your internet plan for faster upload speeds. Optimization Tips for Peak Performance: Strategic Camera Placement:\nPosition cameras to cover important areas while minimizing blind spots. Mount cameras at an appropriate height for optimal coverage. Consider weather conditions and ensure cameras are weather-resistant if placed outdoors. Regular Maintenance Schedule:\nKeep your camera’s lens clean to prevent dirt accumulation. Check for firmware updates regularly to stay up-to-date with improvements. Ensure the camera’s battery is fully charged or properly plugged in. Fine-Tune Motion Detection Settings:\nSet the motion detection sensitivity to a level that minimizes false alerts. Define activity zones to focus on specific areas of interest. Experiment with different motion detection schedules to suit your needs.
