You’ll be living there for at least a year, so you want to make sure you choose a place that you love. To help you make an informed decision, here are a few questions to ask yourself (and the landlord) before you sign a lease:\nWhat’s the monthly rent and security deposit? This is probably the first thing you’ll want to know. The rent should be affordable, and the security deposit should be reasonable.\nWhat utilities are included in the rent? Some landlords include utilities like water, sewer, and trash in the rent. Others charge separately for these utilities. Be sure to find out what’s included so you can budget accordingly.\nWhat kind of appliances are included? Most townhomes come with appliances like a stove, refrigerator, dishwasher, and microwave. But if you have specific appliances that you need, be sure to ask about them before you sign a lease. Imagine your life without a washing machine and dryer. Nightmare right?\nWhat’s the parking situation? If you have a car, you’ll need to know where you’re going to park it. Some townhomes have garages, while others have assigned parking spaces. Still others have street parking. Find out what the parking situation is before you sign a lease.\nWhat amenities are available? Some townhomes have amenities like a pool, fitness center, or playground. If you’re interested in these amenities, be sure to ask about them before you sign a lease.\nWhat are the pet policies? If you have a pet, you’ll need to know if the landlord allows pets. If they do, find out what the pet deposit and pet rent are.\nWhat’s the lease term? Most leases are for one year, but some landlords offer shorter or longer leases. Be sure to find out the lease term before you sign anything.\nCan I see the rental agreement before I sign it? You should always read the rental agreement carefully before you sign it. This will help you understand your rights and responsibilities as a renter.\nKey Takeaways: Research the rental market in your area to understand average rental rates and available townhomes. Consider your budget, including rent, utilities, and other expenses, to determine what you can afford. Visit potential townhomes in person to assess their condition, amenities, and suitability for your needs. Read the rental agreement thoroughly before signing to ensure you understand your rights and responsibilities as a renter.
