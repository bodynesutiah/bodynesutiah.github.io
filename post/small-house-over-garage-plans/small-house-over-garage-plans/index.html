Consider the following questions:\nHow many people will be living in the small house? What activities will you primarily engage in within the space? What kind of storage options do you need? What style and aesthetic appeal do you prefer? Step 2: Choose the Right Garage Space\nThe garage that will house your small house should be structurally sound and have adequate space for both the house and your vehicles.
