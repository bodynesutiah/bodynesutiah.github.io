Heating and Cooling Headaches:\nManaging temperature across three levels can be challenging and costly. Expect higher energy bills compared to single-story living. Sound Sensitivity:\nNoise can easily travel between floors, potentially disrupting your peace and quiet. Consider soundproofing options to minimize disturbances from neighbors.
