Designed to be placed in designated RV parks or campgrounds, they offer a sense of community while retaining the ability to relocate when the wanderlust calls.\nFixed Tiny Homes: Rooted in Place, Embracing Community Fixed tiny homes, unlike their mobile counterparts, are permanently affixed to a foundation. This rootedness fosters a sense of belonging and allows for deeper connections within a chosen community.

Mobile tiny homes offer the freedom to roam and explore new horizons, while park model tiny homes provide a blend of mobility and stability. Fixed tiny homes are rooted in a specific location, fostering a sense of community and belonging.
