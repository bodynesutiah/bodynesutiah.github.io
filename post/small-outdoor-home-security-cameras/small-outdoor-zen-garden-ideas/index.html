Ensure the space is sheltered from strong winds and offers privacy for peaceful meditation. 2. Prepare the Area Clear the area of any debris, rocks, or weeds to create a clean slate.

Balance and Harmony Create a focal point, such as a rock arrangement or a water feature, to draw the eye. Arrange the elements in a visually pleasing manner, considering their size, shape, and texture. Ensure that the garden has a clear path or walkway that allows for easy movement. Maintain a sense of simplicity and avoid cluttering the space. 5. Maintain Your Zen Garden Regularly sweep or rake the gravel or sand to keep it clean and free of debris. Prune plants regularly to maintain their shape and size. Replenish the water in the fountain or waterfall as needed.
