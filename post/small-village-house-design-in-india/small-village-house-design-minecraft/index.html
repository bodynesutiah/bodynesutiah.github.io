Think stone or cobblestone—they’re easy to get and provide a sturdy base. Then, let’s raise those walls! Use a coherent block type—cobblestone, wood, or bricks. Start with a frame of wall outlines and fill ’em up. For extra flair, break up your wall textures with windows and doors. Finish it all off with a sturdy roof—wood planks, for instance. Voila!

Adding a Roof and Windows So, you’ve got your Minecraft village planned out, and now it’s time to start building those charming little houses. When it comes to adding a roof and windows, there are a few things to keep in mind.\nKey Takeaway: Proper roof selection can elevate your village’s visual appeal. Windows add depth and character to your builds, allowing natural light to illuminate your interiors. Experiment with various roof designs to achieve different aesthetics. Choose window designs that complement your village’s architectural style. Don’t forget to add shutters and curtains for extra detail. Designing the Roof: Shape: Gable roofs are classic and easy to build, while hipped roofs provide a more elegant look. Materials: Wood, stone, and terracotta are popular choices for roofs. Experiment with different materials to create unique textures and colors. Details: Add dormers, chimneys, and weather vanes to give your roofs extra character. Choosing Windows: Size and Shape: Consider the size and shape of your windows based on the scale of your house. Tall, narrow windows can add a touch of elegance, while square or rectangular windows provide a more traditional look. Placement: Place your windows strategically to let in natural light and frame beautiful views. Style: Experiment with different window styles, such as casement, awning, or bay windows, to create a unique look for your village houses. Adding Shutters and Curtains: Shutters: Adding shutters to your windows can give your village houses a charming, rustic look.
