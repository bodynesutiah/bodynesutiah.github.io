This is because the modules are built in a factory and then transported to the site and assembled. The entire process can take just a few weeks, compared to several months for a site-built home.</li><li><strong>Customization:</strong> Modular homes can be customized to meet the buyer&rsquo;s needs. You can choose the floor plan, finishes, and other features you want. This flexibility is not always available with site-built homes.</li><li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Modular homes are typically more energy-efficient than site-built homes.
