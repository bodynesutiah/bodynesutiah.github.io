Plan meticulously and set a realistic budget: Clearly define your extension goals, prioritize needs over wants, and gather accurate measurements to avoid costly changes during construction. Create a comprehensive budget that encompasses all project expenses, including materials, labor, permits, and professional fees. Seek advice from professionals such as architects or contractors to help you set a realistic budget. 2.

Purchase materials in advance to avoid delays and potential price increases. Consider phasing the project to spread out costs and make it more manageable. 7.
