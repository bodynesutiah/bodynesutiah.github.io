This means having a specific place in your home where you can work without distractions. Your workspace should be comfortable and well-lit, and it should have everything you need to be productive, such as a desk, a chair, a computer, and a printer.\n2. Establish a Routine When you work from home, it‚Äôs important to establish a routine and stick to it.

Having a routine will help you stay focused and productive, and it will also help you avoid burnout.\n3. Take Breaks It‚Äôs important to take breaks when you‚Äôre working from home. Get up and move around every 20-30 minutes, and take a longer break for lunch. Taking breaks will help you stay focused and productive, and it will also help you avoid eye strain and muscle pain.\n4.

Setting boundaries will help you stay healthy and productive, and it will also help you avoid burnout.\nKey Takeaways: Set up a dedicated workspace that‚Äôs comfortable and well-lit.
