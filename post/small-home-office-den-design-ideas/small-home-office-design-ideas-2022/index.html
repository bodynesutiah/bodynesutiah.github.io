Consider a corner location or a desk perpendicular to a window for optimal light distribution. Choose Sheer Window Dressings: Opt for sheer curtains, blinds, or window films that allow diffused light to enter while maintaining privacy. Avoid heavy drapes that block most of the natural light. Embrace Light-Reflecting Surfaces: Incorporate light-colored walls, furniture, and decor to reflect and amplify natural light. Utilize glossy surfaces like mirrors and metallic accents to bounce light around the room. Experiment with Desk Orientation: Position your desk parallel to the window to enjoy direct natural light. If window placement doesn’t allow for this, consider an L-shaped desk to optimize light exposure.
