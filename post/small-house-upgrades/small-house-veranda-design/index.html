These materials allow light to flow freely, making the space feel more open.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lightweight and Minimalist:</strong> Choose lightweight and minimalist furniture and decor to avoid cluttering the veranda. Clean lines and simple forms create a sense of spaciousness and tranquility.</p></li></ul><h3 id=colors><strong>Colors:</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#colors>#</a></h3><ul><li><p><strong>Neutral Color Palette:</strong> Stick to a neutral color palette with light and airy tones.

Layered lighting also adds depth and drama to the space.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add Mirrors:</strong> Strategically placed mirrors reflect light and visually enlarge the space. Hang them opposite windows or in areas with limited natural light to create the illusion of more space.</p></li><li><p><strong>Connect with Nature:</strong> Bring the beauty of the outdoors onto the veranda by adding potted plants, hanging baskets, or a vertical garden.
