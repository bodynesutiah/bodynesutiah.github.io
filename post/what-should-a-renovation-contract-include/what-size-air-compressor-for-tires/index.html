Yep, that&rsquo;s the rate at which compressed air flows.</p><p>Why does CFM matter? Imagine trying to fill a huge balloon with air using a tiny straw. It&rsquo;d take forever, right? The same goes for inflating tires. If your air compressor&rsquo;s CFM is too low, you&rsquo;ll be stuck waiting and waiting for your tires to fill up. That&rsquo;s no fun, especially when you&rsquo;re in a rush.</p><p>So, how do you figure out the right CFM for your needs? It&rsquo;s a simple calculation based on your tire size and inflation pressure. Follow these steps:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Know Your Tire Size:</strong> Look at your tire&rsquo;s sidewall for its size. It&rsquo;ll be in a format like &ldquo;P225/50R17.&rdquo; The number you need is the first one, which indicates the tire&rsquo;s width in millimeters (225 in this example).</p></li><li><p><strong>Find Your Tire&rsquo;s Inflation Pressure:</strong> Check your vehicle&rsquo;s owner&rsquo;s manual or the sticker on the driver&rsquo;s side door jamb for the recommended inflation pressure. It&rsquo;s usually around 30-35 PSI (pounds per square inch).</p></li><li><p><strong>Do the Math:</strong> Use this formula to calculate the CFM you need:</p></li></ol><blockquote><p><strong>CFM = (Tire Width in Inches x Tire Inflation Pressure in PSI) / 1,000</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For our example tire with a width of 225 millimeters and an inflation pressure of 35 PSI, the calculation would be:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>CFM = (225mm x 35 PSI) / 1,000 = 7.875 CFM</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>That means you&rsquo;ll need an air compressor with a CFM rating of at least 7.875 CFM to inflate your tires efficiently.</p></blockquote><p>Remember, this is just a starting point. If you plan on using your air compressor for other tasks like powering air tools or cleaning your car, you might want to go with a higher CFM rating.</p><p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p><ul><li>CFM (Cubic Feet per Minute) measures the rate of compressed air flow.</li><li>A higher CFM rating means the air compressor can inflate tires faster.</li><li>To calculate the CFM you need, multiply your tire width in inches by the inflation pressure in PSI and divide by 1,000.</li><li>Choose an air compressor with a CFM rating that meets or exceeds your calculated CFM requirement.</li><li>Consider a higher CFM rating if you plan to use the air compressor for other tasks.</li></ul><h2 id=selecting-the-right-size-air-compressor-choose-an-air-compressor-that-meets-or-exceeds-calculated-cfm-requirements-considering-types-advantages-and-disadvantages><strong>Selecting the Right Size Air Compressor: Choose an air compressor that meets or exceeds calculated CFM requirements, considering types, advantages, and disadvantages.</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#selecting-the-right-size-air-compressor-choose-an-air-compressor-that-meets-or-exceeds-calculated-cfm-requirements-considering-types-advantages-and-disadvantages>#</a></h2><p>![](Image of an air compressor being used to inflate a tire)</p><p>Let me walk you through picking the perfect air compressor for your tire needs.</p><h3 id=understanding-air-compressor-specifications><strong>Understanding Air Compressor Specifications</strong><a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#understanding-air-compressor-specifications>#</a></h3><ol><li><p><strong>PSI (pounds per square inch):</strong> This indicates the pressure an air compressor can deliver.
